# Webgl.Testing
A sandbox/testing project in webgl. I use this to get a better understanding of webgl and coding in general. 
I try to use composition when possible, just to see how it is when a project grows bigger and how much reusability I can get out of it. And because I've reached the limitation of classes in other projects and wanted to try something new.

As it stands right now, this project includes:
* A basic rendering engine
* scenes and a scene picker
* rectangle shape
* containers
* random walker + random walker scene

The rendering pipeline is fairly optimized, but could still use some work
